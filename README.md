# dippybird

A simple clojure based blog.   Uses mysql for storing entries (overkill?)

## Motivation

I'm a web application developer, I can't use someone else blog software.    That would be like being a shoemaker and
wearing someone else's shoes.     A simple blogging application is pretty straightforward and I get to design
and craft a solution that meets my own desires.

## Reusable by Others

My intention is that this application can be eaily reused by others.  I intend to use it for multiple blogs myself
(one for me, and a separate blog about my kids, and some project specific blogs), so I will strive to keep the 
configuration and customization straightforward.
 
I image the ideal end user would be another hacker who is familure with mysql and clojure.    They might just look
at this project to see how something is done, or may customize it to suit their own specific needs.
